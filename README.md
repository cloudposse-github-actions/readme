## Introduction

This opinionated implementation builds upon Cloud Posse's build-harness and README.yaml
used throughout Cloud Posse's GitHub repositories.



## Usage



To use this project, follow these steps:

Add the following code to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/readme.yml`):

```yaml
name: README
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ 'main' ]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Rebuild README.md and Banner
        uses: cloudposse-github-actions/readme@v0
        id: readme
        with:
          banner_enabled: true
          readme_enabled: true

    outputs:
      result: ${{ steps.readme.outputs.result1 }}
```

## Advanced Usage

In the following example, we use the `workflow_dispatch` event to allow manual triggering of the workflow to rebuild the readme.  
We also use the `pull_request` event to register the workflow from the PR. This allows us to test the workflow before merging
it to the main branch.

```yaml
  name: README
  on:
    # Allow manual triggering of workflow to rebuild readme
    workflow_dispatch: {}

    ## Added pull_request to register workflow from the PR.

    pull_request:
      branches-ignore: ['*']

  schedule:
    # Update README.md nightly at 4am UTC
    #         .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
    #         |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)

    #         |  |  |  |  |
    - cron:  '0  4  *  *  *'

  jobs:
    generate:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Rebuild README.md and Banner
          uses: cloudposse-github-actions/readme@v0
          id: readme
          with:
            banner_enabled: true
            readme_enabled: true
```
