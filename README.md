## Introduction

This opinionated implementation builds upon Cloud Posse's build-harness and README.yaml
used throughout Cloud Posse's GitHub repositories.



## Usage



> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning GitHub Actions to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation 
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each GitHub Action to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your workflows. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic 
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.



To use this project, follow these steps:

Add the following code to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/readme.yml`):

```yaml
name: README
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ 'main' ]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Rebuild README.md and Banner
        uses: cloudposse-github-actions/readme@v0
        id: readme
        with:
          banner_enabled: true
          readme_enabled: true

    outputs:
      banner_file: ${{ steps.readme.outputs.banner_file }}
      readme_file: ${{ steps.readme.outputs.readme_file }}
```

## Advanced Usage

In the following example, we use the `workflow_dispatch` event to allow manual triggering of the workflow to rebuild the readme.  
We also use the `pull_request` event to register the workflow from the PR. This allows us to test the workflow before merging
it to the main branch.

```yaml
  name: README
  on:
    # Allow manual triggering of workflow to rebuild readme
    workflow_dispatch: {}

    ## Added pull_request to register workflow from the PR.
    ## Read more https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63362126/github-actions-how-to-run-a-workflow-created-on-a-non-master-branch-from-the-wo
    pull_request:
      branches-ignore: ['*']

  schedule:
    # Update README.md nightly at 4am UTC
    #         .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
    #         |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
    #         |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
    #         |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
    #         |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
    #         |  |  |  |  |
    - cron:  '0  4  *  *  *'

  jobs:
    generate:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Rebuild README.md and Banner
          uses: cloudposse-github-actions/readme@v0
          id: readme
          with:
            banner_enabled: true
            readme_enabled: true
```

### Migrating from `v0` to `v1`

`v1` use [atmos](https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/docs/generate) instead of [build-harness](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness).
You can drop `Makefile` if you use it only for readme generation.
To support atmos reaadme generation, you must create `atmos.yaml` config. 
The configuration depends on your repo - please follow this [documentation](https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/docs/generate)

Example: 

```yaml filename="atmos.yaml"
docs:
generate:
  readme:
    base-dir: .
    input:
      - "./README.yaml"
    template: "https://.../README.md.gotmpl"
    output: "./README.md"
    terraform:
      source: src/
      enabled: false
      format: "markdown"
      show_providers: false
      show_inputs: true
      show_outputs: true
      sort_by: "name"
      hide_empty: false
      indent_level: 2
```
