# How to use this project
usage: |-
  To use this project, follow these steps:

  Add the following code to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/readme.yml`):

  ```yaml
  name: README
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches: [ 'main' ]
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

  jobs:
    generate:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Rebuild README.md and Banner
          uses: cloudposse-github-actions/readme@v0
          id: readme
          with:
            banner_enabled: true
            readme_enabled: true

      outputs:
        result: ${{ steps.readme.outputs.result1 }}
  ```

  ## Advanced Usage

  In the following example, we use the `workflow_dispatch` event to allow manual triggering of the workflow to rebuild the readme.  
  We also use the `pull_request` event to register the workflow from the PR. This allows us to test the workflow before merging
  it to the main branch.

  ```yaml
    name: README
    on:
      # Allow manual triggering of workflow to rebuild readme
      workflow_dispatch: {}

      ## Added pull_request to register workflow from the PR.
